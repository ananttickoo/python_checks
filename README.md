Idea is to create a python script which can execute a script on remote node via ssh.
The script that will be executed via remote ssh will be store in a file locally.

so logic dictate ,
1. read the local file which has script stored
2. Login to remote node
3. execute the script
4. gather the output
5. display the output orderly manner 
6. Also interpet the exit code and any command line arguments that are passed. 


challanges 
1. i do not know python
2. i do not have time



modules
1. reads local file
2. logic head which will interpert the output
3. logic head to interpret the thresholds.


This service should be dependent on ssh . 

Mission critical script for enhanced monitoring.
